# inbox-bubble — REEF with Inbox, the visitor's side

The bubble everybody recognises in the bottom-right corner, and deliberately not
a chat client: no presence, no typing indicator, no queue, no "an agent will be
with you shortly". Those exist because the products that have them were built for
a support department, and nearly every REEF customer is one person.

```html
<div data-dynamic-coral="inbox-bubble" data-kind="site" data-id="<site key>"></div>
<script type="module" src="https://feelreef.com/corals/inbox-bubble/v0/inbox-bubble.js"></script>
```

| attribute | |
|---|---|
| `data-kind` | required — `site` \| `card` \| `cardtile` \| `ext` |
| `data-id` | required — the tenant key for that kind |
| `data-kaito` | `"1"` asks the site first (needs REEF with KAITO on that tenant) |
| `data-assistant-name` | what VISITORS see the assistant called instead of "KAITO" (owner-chosen; the panel still marks the reply with the non-removable **AI** chip — the name can change, the AI identity cannot). The BAKED opening answer only: from 0.7.2 the bubble also reads the platform's current value once per mount (`GET /api/inbox/assistant`) and patches the two nodes that carry the name, so an owner's rename reaches visitors without a republish. That read only beats the baked value when the proxy says it actually asked the platform (`resolved: true` in the body) — which is also how CLEARING the name works: a resolved empty answer means「no override」and falls back to KAITO, while an empty answer without `resolved` means「we could not ask」and this attribute stands |
| `data-api-base` | override the feelreef origin (previews) |
| `data-open-label` / `data-title` / `data-placeholder` / `data-send-label` | copy overrides |

Words default from the PAGE's `<html lang>` — the site's own statement about who
it is for, not a guess and not the visitor's browser preference. Unknown language
falls back to English.

From 0.7.3 the ask panel says two things, not four (owner ruling 2026-09-07,
「太囉唆」): the status line under the site name —「\<名字\>**AI**先回，轉出去真人會看」—
and the box's own placeholder. The body line in the empty log and the
「站主看得到」 footer under the form are gone in every locale, and
`data-empty-label` went with the string it overrode.

## Opening the panel programmatically

From 0.7.4, two ways in besides a visitor's own click — both inert unless this coral is actually
mounted on the page, because neither is wired until a `mount()` for a valid `data-kind`/`data-id`
has already run:

- `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('reef-inbox:open'))` — a site's own link (a footer "report
  a problem" anchor, say) can open the panel in place instead of sending the visitor to another
  page.
- `#inbox` in the page's URL fragment at load — honoured once, at mount, the same way.

Either reaches exactly what a click on the closed bubble reaches, so it focuses the ask/compose
input the same way every other way into the panel already does — there is no separate focus path
to keep in sync.

## The three things not to break

**It never claims anyone is there.** The panel shows a reply window only when the
owner actually set a number. No presence, ever — that is no-phantom applied to a
person, and a person is far easier to feel lied to about than a widget.

**The conversation id comes from the SERVER.** This browser stores what the server
minted and sends it back; it never invents one. A browser that can choose an id
can choose whose conversation to open. The handle expires locally after seven
days; the owner's copy never expires.

**A KAITO answer is never stored and never joins the transcript.** It is a machine
quoting one of the owner's own pages; a message is a person speaking. Only the
visitor's own question travels when they press the button — and the press is the
point: a refusal is common, and turning every one into an interruption is the
bubble this product exists not to be.

## Styling

Every colour is a `--reef-inbox-*` custom property with a neutral fallback, so a
site's theme wins without this file knowing anything about it. Dark mode follows
`prefers-color-scheme`; the entrance animation respects reduced motion.

## Publishing

Registry pipeline, same as every coral — bump `package.json`, `node
packages/dynamic-corals/build.mjs inbox-bubble`, repoint `registry/manifest.json`,
`registry/deploy.sh`. 🔴 Never `cp` a fix somewhere; the URL above is the only copy
anyone consumes.
